<p>You agree that, if required by a User or for participation in a particular program for Moving Pros, PMG may conduct a background criminal or credit, evaluation of reputation and character or other assessment, and you will cooperate fully in that process. If your background check or other check is not successful (as determined by PMG in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law), PMG may deactivate or suspend your account and/or terminate or suspend your ability to accept work through the applicable program, as PMG determines appropriate in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>If you accept a Marketplace Work Order on which a User or applicable law requires background-checked Personnel, you will only send Personnel for whom you have proof of a passing background check to fulfill those Marketplace Work Orders. Any falsification of background check proof will be grounds for immediate removal from PMG. PMG reserves the right to randomly audit all Personnel on any Marketplace Work Order requiring background checked Personnel. PMG reserves the right to suspend or remove you from the Platform for sending non-background checked Personnel to fulfill a Marketplace Work Order requiring background checked Personnel. If anything occurs that could jeopardize your background status of any of your Personnel, you agree to immediately notify PMG. Personnel whose background checks are in jeopardy must either pass a new background check or may not fulfill any Marketplace Work Orders. PMG also reserves the right to randomly require all Personnel to resubmit new background checks at any time in order to stay in the program. Personnel must pass new background checks periodically to be eligible to fulfill Marketplace Work Orders.</p>

Similarly, if you accept any Work Order in which a User or applicable law requires you or your Personnel to be drug tested, you will only send Personnel for whom you have submitted proof of passing a drug test to fulfill those Work Orders. Any falsification of drug-testing proof or sending non-tested Personnel to fulfill any Work Order that requires drug-testing will be grounds for immediate deactivation of your account. PMG reserves the right to randomly audit Personnel on any Work Order requiring drug tested Personnel. If anything occurs that could jeopardize the drug test status of any Personnel, you agree to notify PMG immediately. All Personnel whose drug test status is in jeopardy must either pass a new drug test or be removed from fulfilling a Work Order in which a User or law requires drug-testing. PMG also reserves the right to randomly require Personnel to resubmit new drug tests at any time. All Personnel must pass new drug tests periodically to fulfill any Work Order that requires drug-tested Personnel.</p>
